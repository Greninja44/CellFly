## June 17 Night – Tiny Whoop Research :D  ~~~~ 1-1.5 hours

Today night I didn’t do any building work,just full research.Got fully into the world of tiny whoops —>kept watching YouTube videos one after another. Started with basic builds but then I ended up seeing modded whoops, freestyle edits, tuning guides, and even long-range micro whoops Even though I’m building a nano 18650 cruiser, watching these gave me lots of ideas. Tiny whoops are crazy efficient — most of them run on 1S and still fly solid for 4–5 mins. People use super light components like micro motors and even BT2.0 connectors instead of bulky XT30. They tune everything so tightly just to save 0.5g.
I saw how clean their wiring is, how compact the builds are. Everything matters in these small frames — even motor wire position and capacitor size. I think some of that applies to my build too. No ducts in my case, but weight saving and clean layout is definitely something I need to focus on more now.

Also watched a few Indian FPV pilots doing whoop builds with parts sourced locally, gave me confidence that even simple setups can perform well if done right. Now I’m thinking, maybe I can apply some whoop techniques to my frame design — especially how they mount batteries and route wires so neatly.

So yeah,. Tomorrow I'll probably go back to Fusion360 and rethink a few things based on what I learnt tonight.
