## June 17 Night – Tiny Whoop Research :D  ~~~~ 1-1.5 hours

Today night I didn’t do any building work,just full research.Got fully into the world of tiny whoops —>kept watching YouTube videos one after another. Started with basic builds but then I ended up seeing modded whoops, freestyle edits, tuning guides, and even long-range micro whoops Even though I’m building a nano 18650 cruiser, watching these gave me lots of ideas. Tiny whoops are crazy efficient — most of them run on 1S and still fly solid for 4–5 mins. People use super light components like micro motors and even BT2.0 connectors instead of bulky XT30. They tune everything so tightly just to save 0.5g.
I saw how clean their wiring is, how compact the builds are. Everything matters in these small frames — even motor wire position and capacitor size. I think some of that applies to my build too. No ducts in my case, but weight saving and clean layout is definitely something I need to focus on more now.

Also watched a few Indian FPV pilots doing whoop builds with parts sourced locally, gave me confidence that even simple setups can perform well if done right. Now I’m thinking, maybe I can apply some whoop techniques to my frame design — especially how they mount batteries and route wires so neatly.

So yeah,. Tomorrow I'll probably go back to Fusion360 and rethink a few things based on what I learnt tonight.

## June 18 Night – Parts selection :D(1:00 pm) ~~~~ 1-1.5 hours
First we need brain for our build....
So I picked the Flywoo GOKU F405 Nano 13A AIO because bro, it just makes sense for my build. I’m going with 2x 18650 Li-ion cells, and this AIO handles 1–2S power like a champ—no voltage drama,btw i fried kk2 flight controller before :(. It has  F405 chip, which is solid for Betaflight and doesn’t lag like those cheap chin-e-se-e boards. Plus, the 13A ESCs are already built-in, so I don’t have to mess with extra wires or waste space. It's super compact and lightweight, perfect for a 3-inch drone. And honestly, Flywoo is a chill brand—popular in the community and you can find it online in India without much hassle. Clean setup, decent power, less headache. Total value-for-money   also also it has c typeeeeee

Next so that we selected aio, we need to look on motors now
I went with the Flywoo ROBO 1202.5 11500KV motor because it's small but powerful—just right for a 3-inch build with 18650 cells. It’s super lightweight, so I won’t lose flight time or efficiency. The 11500KV rating is solid for 1–2S setups, and it’ll give me that quick throttle response without killing the batteries too fast. Also, it matches perfectly with the GOKU no tension BOSS, paisa vasool for sure

You can buy on robu or quadkart :https://robu.in/product/flywoo-robo-1202-5-11500kv-1pc/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=17419548928&gbraid=0AAAAADvLFWcP_heyelJofAKjckUvH3lkh&gclid=CjwKCAjwx8nCBhAwEiwA_z__022kY_rbuMXziUq0JqhvDjaNAlSUy6PoJ4jmkEZ93v-s-6t3XgQYkBoCCGcQAvD_BwE

I decided to go with both the 2-blade and tri-blade props ( i want to test out and compare the best props) because I wanted flexibility depending on the flying style. The 2 blede are lightweight and super efficient—perfect for longer flight times and chill cruising. On the other hand, the 3 inch  give more control, better grip, and that snappy feel when I want to pull off freestyle tricks or fly tight lines ( which mostly i wont coz im chill guy). Both are 2mm hub, so they fit my motors easily, and honestly, switching them out based on the vibe feels way more fun ( im delusional ).

now we have the core components its time that we look upon the fpv system
I picked the Caddx Ant 1200TVL cause it's seriously clean for FPV ,great detail and ultra-light, so my drone stays nimble even with 18650s 
( yt footages were crazy asf) . It has built-in OSD (  absically displays things like volatge altitude throttle percentage on fpv using betaflight) too. For the VTX, I went with the HGLRC Zeus Nano—compact, powerful (350mW). The combo is like plug-and-play for micro builds. Video feed will be solid, range will be solid, and weight? Barely anything. What more do I need?( Funds)

So now that we choosed our camera and vts its time for the googles
( cheap and avaible in india) which supports my ca,era and vtx:https://fpvguru.in/product/iflight-analog-fpv-goggles-with-dvr-function/

I chose the iFlight analog goggles cause they’re perfect for my build—budget-friendly, lightweight, and come with a built-in DVR, so I can record all my flights and cringe later when I crash into a tree ( jking). The screen’s decent size (4.3 inches ah), and the 40-channel receiver means I’ll always find a clean frequency to fly on. Plus, it runs for around 3.5 hours with its own battery, so no stress about external packs. Picked them up from FPVGuru (Bengaluru), so it’s fast shipping, no customs tension, and no imported mark-up. Feels like a smart desi pick for my first proper FPV setup!
