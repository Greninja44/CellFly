# CellFly

CellFly is a small 18650 2S FPV drone project I am building using a custom frame and off-the-shelf parts. It’s fully modular, lightweight, and designed mainly for learning and FPV. Everything is made from scratch — the 3D design,Drawings

## Whats special in this Drone
Im using 2S 18650 batteries because they’re cheaper, easier to find, and give longer flight times compared to regular LiPos. They’re also safer to handle, have good energy density, and are perfect for low-amp setups with small motors. For casual flying and learning, they’re more practical and reliable without adding much weight.and also in india lipo are very expensive and even chargers... omg are very hard to find


## Parts Used

I designed and built the following parts for the drone:

- **Main Frame**
- **Base Plate**
- **Plate Joint**
- **Battery Holder**

All the design and drawing files are available as step and PDF in this repo.

## Electronics Used

- **Flight Controller : custom
- **Motors:** Pro-Range-D0703-12000KV 
- **Camera:** Caddx Ant Nano
- **VTX:** HGLRC Zeus Nano 350mW
- **Props:** Gemfan 3018 2-blade and 3016 tri-blade
- **Battery:** Sony VTC6 18650 Li-ion (x2)
- **FPV Goggles:** iFlight Analog Goggles with DVR





The whole build will cost  around (approx $275 USD). You can check the full list in the `CellFly.xlsx` file in this repo.

## Why I Made This

I wanted to build a drone completely from scratch — not just buy a frame and plug stuff in..I've always loved FPV drones — the speed, the freedom, the tech behind how they work. Ever since I was a kid  ( weeknd Tune) , I dreamt of building my own. CellFly is that dream finally coming to life. I designed the entire frame myself, picked every partt.I’m sharing everything here so others can learn from it too — just like I did. This was made for Highway's Hack Club, and I hope it inspires more teens to build their own drones.


## Why it deserves 10 points
 I designed and built everything from scratch. I used affordable parts easily available in India, including 18650 batteries for better safety and longer flight time. It’s fully functional, gives real FPV output, and is documented properly so others can build it too. I’ve dreamt of making a FPV drone , and this was made with full effort, combining design, electronics in one project.
